# base model Python 3.11.5, but we use python 3.11-slim
# Slimmed-down version of the latest 3.11 release.
# Based on debian, but stripped of unnecessary files like man pages, docs, dev tools.
# Much smaller in size (~30â€“50% smaller than the full version).
# Suitable for production, where smaller image size = faster deploys.
